**Mission Objective:** Acquire Doctorate.
**Current Sol:** [Year 3, Day 2]
**Location:** The Library / The Lab / The Void

## Manifesto
This repository is the digital fossil record of my evolution from a wide-eyed student to a cynical researcher. It captures the incremental progress of scientific inquiry, preserving the "Eureka!" moments alongside the "Why is this happening?" moments.

## The Map (Contents)

### Phase I: The Origin
Notes on foundational theories and the initial spark of the research question.
*(See: [`year_1 to year_2`](https://damilolaneal.github.io/my_phd_notes/posts/wake_up_call.html))*

### Phase II: The Valley of Despair
Detailed logs of data collection, debugging, and the rigorous testing of patience.
*(See: [`/experiments`](https://damilolaneal.github.io/my_phd_notes) and [`/failed_attempts`](https://damilolaneal.github.io/my_phd_notes))*

### Phase III: The Synthesis
Structuring the chaos into a coherent narrative.
*(See: `/upcoming`)*

## Observation Highlights
> **Note to self:** If the data looks too good to be true, you probably messed up the input variables.

## Contribution
If you are my supervisor: **"Everything is under control."**
If you are a fellow student: **"I have no idea what I'm doing."**
