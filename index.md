Welcome to My PhD Journey Blog

Hi there!  
This blog is my digital notebook — a place where I document the papers I read, the new concepts I learn, and the milestones (big and small) along my PhD journey.  

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious learner, or just someone interested in what a PhD life looks like, I hope you’ll find something useful or inspiring here.
