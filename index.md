# Welcome to My PhD Journey Blog

Hi there!  
This blog is my digital notebook — a place where I document the papers I read, the new concepts I learn, and the milestones (big and small) along my PhD journey.  

Whether you're a fellow researcher, a curious learner, or just someone interested in what a PhD life looks like, I hope you’ll find something useful or inspiring here.

## 🚀 Let’s Begin

This is the wake up call though, this is the email I received after passing my comprehensive examination and working like crazy to complete my proposal draft.

> From: Mudassir Masood Ali
​
> To: DAMILOLA OLAWOYIN-YUSSUF​
> Assalam u alaikum
> Dear Damilola

> I am writing to inform you that you were not able to satisfactorily complete your PhD thesis proposal and thus defend this semester. As discussed earlier in my office, the proposal document  you submitted was incomplete and did not meet the expected academic and technical standards for EE711. In particular, the work lacked sufficient technical rigor, convincing initial results,  and a clear original methodology. Additionally, the extensive use of AI-generated text beyond getting help for improving your self-written sentences is completely unacceptable.

> As a result, you will receive a failing grade in EE711 for this term.

> That said, I want to emphasize that this outcome should not delay you from making progress moving forward. You should continue working immediately on strengthening the technical foundations  of your research, developing meaningful and defensible initial results, and substantially improving the quality, originality, and conciseness of your writing.

> I expect you to propose a realistic and clear timeline for completing a revised proposal and scheduling your defense. You should not wait until the end of the next term to do so. Please send me your well-thought proposed plan and milestones in the coming weeks so that I can assess whether you are on track. When proposing the timeline, please keep in mind that you may have to revise the proposal a number of times based on my feedback before it could be shared with the committee members. Also, I would like to remind you that starting next semester you should continue to meet regularly to discuss your progress.

> I strongly advise you to approach the next phase of your PhD with focus, discipline, and academic integrity. I am willing to provide guidance and support, but the responsibility to demonstrate readiness for proposal defense rests with you.

> Regards
> Mudassir
